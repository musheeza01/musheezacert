# Soil Tester
#### Purpose
Statement of Work Template intended for Datacenter Volunteer Lead Community Engagements.  

#### Materials
1 AAA Battery housing

6 AAA Batteries (3 spare)

1 Circuit Playground Express

2 Minigrabber test lead cables or Alligator Clip test lead cables

2 large paper clips (2”) – (without plastic coating)

Data/Sync USB Cable

2 cups soil, 1 with plant or 2 potted plants


#### Before
Test the equipment Start Procedure below and note any failures or missing items as described in After Procedure below.  For help, use the Get Help information below.  Internet access will be required to download the CPX program.

### Start
Read through  [Source 1](#Source-1) below. When you are ready, move the image ([Source 2](#Source-2)) to the CPX.  Use instructions located here: [Source 2](#Source-2).  Test the program.

#### Get Ready
**Prep the soil**: Add water to one pot/cup of soil.  Leave the other pot/cup dry.

**Prep the lead cables**: Straighten both paperclips, leaving the outer edge bent at a sweeping 90°.  Insert the batteries into the battery pack.  Connect one end of the black test lead cable to the GND on the CPX.  Connect the other end to a paper clip.  Place the paper clip into the moistened soil. Connect one end of the red test lead cable to the A1 port on the CPX.  Connect the other end of the red test lead cable to the second paper clip.  Insert the paper clip into the dry pot/cup of soil.  

**Power the CPX**: Insert the batteries into the battery pack.  Connect the battery pack to the CPX. Power on the battery pack.

#### Go
The running program will refresh every two seconds.  Let the device come to temperature.  With the battery connector facing straight down, the right-side LEDs will display all red (needs water/not conductive) or all green (has water/conductive).  The lights on the left-side will display the temperature with 2°F increments. See  [Appendix](#Appendix) for Details. Use the [Lesson](#Lesson) information to explain the lab to relatable concepts at the Datacenter.


### After
Note any items that are damaged, not working, or missing (including consumables) as noted in Get Help below.
